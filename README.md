Our robot's objective is to move efficiently along the track. In order to maximize each turn and obstacle, the DYCI Primes 3.0 made sure to design a program that identifies the distance between the three sides of the robot. We have used 3 ultrasonic sensors to determine whether the robot needs to turn 90 degrees, avoid a potential obstacle and automatically center itself if necessary depending on the situation.

The robot turns on its motors; when the sum of the left and right sensors exceeds 150 cm, the robot will then determine which ultrasonic sensor gave the greater value and turn towards the direction of the corresponding ultrasonic sensor's side that gave the greater value. However, if the front ultrasonic sensor then detects something in its path within 10 cm and the sum of the left and right sensors doesn't exceed 150 cm, it means the robot has detected an obstacle; the robot will then determine whether the left or right ultrasonic sensor possesses the greater value and turn accordingly to avoid the incoming obstacle. When the robot finally turns 90 degrees, it adds a value of 1 to a variable named 'rotation'; once the value had reached 12, meaning the robot has now turned three times, the robot then ends the program.
